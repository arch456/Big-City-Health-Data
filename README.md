# Big-City-Health-Data
This project aims to utilize statistical methods such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees, to analyze the major factors that influence smoking and drinking issues among high school students as well as adults in the most populated urban cities of the United States. 

The dataset being used is Big Cities Health data [1] which contains health status of twentyeight of the nation’s largest and most urban cities, as captured by 34 health (and six demographics-related) indicators. Each city is rich with its own culture and history and we are considering the demographics of the subjects that are disproportionately scattered among the cities. 

Questions of Interest The main objective of the project is to address the following questions: 
i) What are the major factors causing smoking and drinking problems among High School students in the most urban cities of the United States? How much are these conditions influenced by the place, ethnicity, and gender of the students? 
ii) Similarly, how much effect do predictors like place, gender and ethnicity have on smoking and drinking problems among adults in US’s biggest cities? 

These questions have been chosen as the basis of research because smoking and binge drinking are major issues of concern especially among young students, and lead to dropouts, termination and such outcomes. Therefore, if analysis can be performed to identify influencing factors, the result can be utilized to curb such problems to an extent. The intention is to conduct statistical analysis and inference using appropriate methods to isolate any underlying factors and help regulate these societal problems from the core.
